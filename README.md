## Suggested Steps

The starting point of this project is the target of the previous project, Filebox with only Bootstrap.

In this project, you'll practice going the last mile to really make your page your own, rather than being satisfied with vanilla Bootstrap styles.

Write additional CSS rules in `additional_styles.css` and apply them to your elements. You may have to add additional `div`s or other elements to your HTML as well.

It takes surprisingly few lines of custom CSS to match our target.
